    <h1>Clear Skies, Hidden Dangers</h1>
    <p>Avalanche danger often lingers after storms, especially when rapid temperature changes weaken the snowpack. Solar radiation can warm slopes, triggering loose snow slides or slab avalanches, particularly on south-facing aspects. Cold temperatures, on the other hand, can preserve weak layers beneath the surface, creating hidden hazards. Checking daily avalanche forecasts and observing snow conditions firsthand are critical steps in making safe decisions.</p>

    <p>Recent avalanche activity is one of the strongest indicators of instability. If you see signs of recent slides, cracking in the snow, or hear "whumphing" sounds beneath your feet, it's a warning that the snowpack may be unstable. Traveling with a partner, carrying proper safety equipment, and choosing lower-angle terrain can greatly reduce your risk. Even experienced skiers and riders should remain cautious and ready to turn back if conditions seem questionable.</p>

    <h2>Smart Decisions Save Lives</h2>
    <p>Group decision-making plays a crucial role in backcountry safety. Excitement and bluebird conditions can sometimes lead to complacency, increasing the likelihood of risky choices. Before setting out, discuss possible hazards, agree on safe routes, and establish a plan for communicating and regrouping. Having an open mindset and being willing to adjust plans based on changing conditions can make all the difference.</p>

    <p>Though clear skies may signal adventure, they don't guarantee safety. By staying informed, making conservative choices, and respecting avalanche warnings, backcountry travelers can enjoy the mountains while minimizing risks. A perfect day in the backcountry is one where everyone returns home safely.</p>

    <h3>Respect the Backcountry, Return Home Safe</h3>
    <p>Blue skies and fresh snow create the perfect backdrop for adventure, but safety should always come first. Avalanche risks can persist long after storms pass, making preparation, awareness, and smart decision-making essential. By checking conditions, traveling with the right gear, and staying cautious in uncertain terrain, backcountry travellers can enjoy the mountains while ensuring a safe return. The best days in the backcountry are the ones you get to experience again.</p>
